      <span className='paragraph'> 
      I'm currently in my final year in Trinity College Dublin, where I'm majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Business.
      I also am currently working for NoCo, where we're planning to redefine the property leasing market here in Ireland.
      I'd consider myself a curious and creative person. I love learning about topics that genuinely fascinate me.

      There isn't a primary purpose to this site; it'll always be evolving. Right now, I'm using it as a kind of online CV to host my
      experience and education.
      On top of this, I'll be sharing various things that have interested me - think of it as an archive
      for my thoughts and projects. </span>
